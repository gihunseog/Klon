The military remains have a social and historic value in holding up a true mirror to modern history of war and suffering, and will be used for historic place in Korea.
This study is to research the military remains of Korean War (1950～53) in Central border line around Yeonchen, Cheorwon, and Hwacheon-gun, as well as Nakdong river region where UN forces and South Korean army established final line defense and Mount. Jiri region where South Korean forces deployed suppressing operations against Bbalchisan - North Korean troops that didn't retreat and continued resisting after the Operation Chromite.
In the Central border of DMZ, Yeoncheon-gun is installing ‘Yeolsoe’ and ‘Taepung’ observatory in the frontline battlefield adjacent to Southern Limit Line(SLL), not only to protect so many military remains including war memorial and crematory facilities of UN troops, but also to utilize them as active educational places. The Cheorwon-gun is actively making known of ‘Baengmagoji memorial, ‘Labor party office’ and other buildings adjacent to ‘Tourist security DMZ’, but needs to set up many monuments around battlefields of ‘Gimhwa’ and ‘Daeseongsan’ adjacent to ‘Eco-peace park DMZ’. With the battlefield of ‘Paroho’ as the center, which our troops made brilliant military gains during the war, The Hwacheon-gun is protecting and informing military remains such as ‘643 and 490 battlefields’, ‘Kkeomeok and Guman bridge’, and the battlefield of ‘Paroho’ - place where South Korean forces made brilliant military gains during the war. With development of a network for military remains in connection with the annual local festivals, the experience-oriented tour and public education on national security will be available at these places.

<strong>In Nakdong river region, which was the final line of defense during the Korean War, was the place where South Korean and US troops first deployed allied defense operations around Masan-Weguan-Yeounchun-Pohang regions from August to September, 1950. This operations was the foothold of counterattack that allowed Operation Chromite to bear successful result</strong>; notable battlefields include 'Andong-gyo battlefield', 'Dabu-dong battlefield', and Bakjin-Naru battlefield'. Moreover, newly constructed Chil-gok peace memorial, Dabu-dong war memeorial, and Bak-kin war memorial is playing a significant role in educating the public about national security.
Mount. Jiri region embodies evidences of battlefields where South Korean troops held against North Korean advance, site of assembly and enlistment points where troops and supplies were reinforced, and area where BBalchisan was suppressed. Notable landmarks include 'Gochang Yongdae-ri battlefield, 'Jeonju recruitment point, 'Gunsan recruitment point for student-led forces', and ’Damyang Yongchubong Bbalchisan suppression ground. Sanchung-gun opened 'Mount Jiri Bbalchisan suppression memorial' to introduce the background and nature of Bbalchisan, as well as to provide visitors a first-hand experience by developing four experimental routes.
There are several aspects of managing and utilizing these military remains as active educational places and tour resources for national security.
First, while military remains centered at live battlefields of the Korean war is well-protected and utilized, Yeoncheon-gun lacks efforts to recover modified battlefields and to develop contents about involvement of UN troops. Cherwon-gun needs to expand tourist facilities regarding Daesungsan and Gimhwa battlefield, and Hwacheon-gun could establish experimental groups for national security that embraces Central border line through efforts such as developing promenade that connects 'Paroho national security museum' to other registrated cultural assets. Officials of Nakdong river region would have to develop tour resources in link to many battlefields and war memorials located in upper, middle, and lower stream of the river as well as to Chilgok peace memorial, while those of Mount. Jiri region also should develop tour resources and experimental aspects centered around grounds of Rear Support Operation and Bbalchisan hideout as well as its suppression ground.
Secondly, apart from battlefields, efforts to allow public to experience military status of both wartime and current situation such as by linking active military watchtowers to military remains are necessary. Moreover, as historic cultural resources, buildings and bridges should be registered as cultural asset and be protected. These structures can also be utilized as infra-resources of local tour business and can embrace the entire region as unified tour ground if connected with annual local festivals
Lastly, there are many abandoned military relics and battlefields such as Yeoncheon UN crematory and Cherwon Sudo-guk Geumsu tower. These resources could be utilized as experimental places for national security and tour routes by furnishing written and video materials or developing in connection with nearby military evidences.
As seen,<u> military remains of the Korean War are valuable cultural assets that frankly illustrate the pain and suffering of the war.</u> Through avid protection and management of these remains, we should utilize these assets not only as live educational places of national security but also as resources of local tour infrastructure. Also, local governments and Ministry of National Defense should recover the remains of KIAs of the Korean war and other military relics; they should also unearth value and records of facilities created during 68 years of post-war periods and prepare institutional scheme such as enacting laws regarding their protection and maintenance.
